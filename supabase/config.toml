# Supabase CLI project config
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Replace the project_id below with your actual Supabase project ref
#   from the Supabase dashboard (Project Settings → General).
# - This file is used by the Supabase CLI only and is NOT loaded by the app
#   at runtime. The app still reads environment variables from `.env.local`.
#
# CLI Authentication:
# - The CLI uses the Supabase access token from `supabase login` for authentication.
# - When applying migrations, the CLI uses the service_role_key (not anon_key)
#   for privileged database operations.
# - The anon_key is only used by frontend clients and is not relevant for CLI operations.
#
# After setting this, run:
#   npx supabase login
#   npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID
#
